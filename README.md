# Excel_Project_Data_Analytics

---

## Introduction

This Excel project was developed by following Luke Barousse’s *Excel for Data Analytics* YouTube tutorial series, which offered a structured, hands-on journey from beginner-level skills to advanced data analytics techniques. The main objective of this project was to build a strong foundation in Excel for data analysis—progressing from essential formulas and formatting to powerful tools like **Power Query, Power Pivot, and creating relationships between tables.** Throughout the process, I also learned to apply **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** within Power Pivot to create dynamic calculations and measures, enabling more flexible and insightful analysis.

While the original tutorial featured Project 1 as an Excel-based Salary Dashboard, I decided to take a different approach. Instead of building it entirely in Excel, I recreated the Salary Dashboard using **Power BI**. This decision leveraged Power BI’s advanced visualization capabilities, interactive filtering, and ability to work seamlessly with the clean, structured data prepared in Excel. It also allowed me to showcase my Power BI skills, particularly integrating Excel’s ETL process with Power BI’s modeling and visualization features.

The Excel portion of my work focused on a complete ETL process for the **Data Science Jobs 2023 dataset**—including data importing, cleaning, and transformation in Power Query, creating relationships and calculated measures in Power Pivot using DAX, and preparing the data model for advanced analytics. The process was documented with screenshots to illustrate each transformation step. The final dataset from Excel served as the foundation for the interactive Power BI Salary Dashboard.

Through this project, I learned how to use Excel from the ground up—starting at zero knowledge and building toward an efficient, real-world-ready workflow. Luke Barousse’s tutorial not only equipped me with Excel’s analytical capabilities but also showed me how to integrate Excel and Power BI into a cohesive business intelligence pipeline.

**Skills Gained & Use Cases**

1. **Excel Basics (Formulas, Formatting, and Functions)**

   * *Use Case:* Quickly calculating, summarizing, and formatting data for reports, such as generating KPI tables or preparing quick insights for stakeholders.

2. **Power Query (Data Cleaning and Transformation)**

   * *Use Case:* Automating repetitive data preparation tasks like removing duplicates, merging datasets, or reshaping large datasets before analysis.

3. **Power Pivot (Data Modeling & DAX Calculations)**

   * *Use Case:* Creating calculated measures (e.g., average salary, count of job postings) for dynamic dashboards and advanced reporting without altering raw data.

4. **Creating Relationships Between Tables**

   * *Use Case:* Connecting multiple datasets (e.g., job details, locations, salary ranges) for a unified analysis without duplicating data.

5. **ETL Documentation (Process Screenshots & Workflow Tracking)**

   * *Use Case:* Keeping a clear audit trail for projects, making it easier to explain and reproduce results for clients or in job interviews.

6. **Power BI Dashboard Development**

   * *Use Case:* Building interactive, visually appealing dashboards for real-time data exploration, enabling end-users to filter and drill down into the insights they need.
