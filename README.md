# Excel_Project_Data_Analytics

---

## Introduction

This Excel project was developed by following Luke Barousse’s *Excel for Data Analytics* YouTube tutorial series, which offered a structured, hands-on journey from beginner-level skills to advanced data analytics techniques. The main objective of this project was to build a strong foundation in Excel for data analysis—progressing from essential formulas and formatting to powerful tools like **Power Query, Power Pivot, and creating relationships between tables.** Throughout the process, I also learned to apply **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** within Power Pivot to create dynamic calculations and measures, enabling more flexible and insightful analysis.

While the original tutorial featured Project 1 as an Excel-based Salary Dashboard, I decided to take a different approach. Instead of building it entirely in Excel, I recreated the Salary Dashboard using **Power BI**. This decision leveraged Power BI’s advanced visualization capabilities, interactive filtering, and ability to work seamlessly with the clean, structured data prepared in Excel. However, due to being a free user and unable to publish and share the report through the Power BI Service, the dashboard will only be presented as an **offline overview** rather than a fully interactive, publicly accessible report. The Power BI Salary Dashboard will be published in a separate repository, while this repository focuses solely on my Excel learning and data preparation process. It also allowed me to showcase my Power BI skills, particularly integrating Excel’s ETL process with Power BI’s modeling and visualization features.

The Excel portion of my work focused on a complete ETL process for the **Data Science Jobs 2023 dataset**—including data importing, cleaning, and transformation in Power Query, creating relationships and calculated measures in Power Pivot using DAX, and preparing the data model for advanced analytics. The process was documented with screenshots to illustrate each transformation step. The final dataset from Excel served as the foundation for the interactive Power BI Salary Dashboard.

Through this project, I learned how to use Excel from the ground up—starting at zero knowledge and building toward an efficient, real-world-ready workflow. Luke Barousse’s tutorial not only equipped me with Excel’s analytical capabilities but also showed me how to integrate Excel and Power BI into a cohesive business intelligence pipeline.

**Skills Gained & Use Cases**

**1. Excel Basics (Formulas, Formatting, and Functions)**

* Use Case: Quickly calculating, summarizing, and formatting data for reports, such as preparing KPI tables or summary sheets for stakeholders.

**2. Power Query (Data Cleaning and Transformation)**

* Use Case: Automating repetitive data preparation steps like removing duplicates, merging tables, reshaping columns, and handling missing values before analysis.

**3. Power Pivot (Data Modeling & Advanced Calculations)**

* Use Case: Creating complex data models with multiple tables and building relationships for scalable analysis without altering raw data.

**4. DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**

* Use Case: Writing calculated measures (e.g., Average Salary by Role, Total Job Postings) to enable flexible analysis that adjusts dynamically to filters and slicers.

**5. Creating Relationships Between Tables**

* Use Case: Linking datasets such as job details, locations, and salary ranges, allowing unified and consistent reporting.

**6. ETL Documentation & Workflow Tracking**

* Use Case: Capturing each stage of the transformation process with screenshots, enabling reproducibility, transparency, and easy explanation during interviews or client presentations.

**7. Power BI Dashboard Development (Overview)**

* Use Case: Producing an offline dashboard overview that demonstrates how prepared Excel datasets can be imported, modeled, and visualized in Power BI—highlighting cross-platform skills even without publishing through the Power BI Service.

**8. Excel–Power BI Integration**

* Use Case: Preparing clean, structured Excel datasets ready for seamless import into Power BI, ensuring that reports remain accurate and maintain data integrity across platforms.
